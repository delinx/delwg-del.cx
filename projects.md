### Static Website Generator
I started this project because I wanted a simple tool to generate my website from markdown files. I focused on keeping the general workflow simple and ended up making my own flavour of markdown to add some missing features. This version of the project is deprecated since I eventually decided to move from C++ to Rust, both for the learning experience and since I think Rust is a better language for this type of project.

### Static Website Generator Rust
Static website generator is a wonderful project for learning a new language, and you can make it as simple or complex as you wish. In its heart, static site generation is just a file/string manipulation logic. While this project originally started in C++, I later moved it to Rust, both as a means of learning it and because I consider it a better-fitting language for this task. 

This website is actually generated using it! You can find repositories below for the generator itself and the markdown files it uses.
