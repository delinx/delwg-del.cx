## General Projects

<<<delwg>>>
### Static Website Generator
I started this project because I wanted a simple tool to generate my website from markdown files. I focused on keeping the general workflow simple and ended up making my own flavour of markdown to add some missing features. This version of the project is deprecated since I eventually decided to move from C++ to Rust, both for the learning experience and since I think Rust is a better language for this type of project.

### Static Website Generator Rust
Static website generator is a wonderful project for learning a new language, and you can make it as simple or complex as you wish. In its heart, static site generation is just a file/string manipulation logic. While this project originally started in C++, I later moved it to Rust, both as a means of learning it and because I consider it a better-fitting language for this task. 

I found myself enjoying Rust; while I am still learning it, I can appreciate a lot of architectural and design decisions involved. Initially, I gave Rust a go a couple of years back, but I found it challenging to get into it, later I got interested in Zig and spent significant time learning its standard library; while [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) is not ready for production use yet, it certainly gave me an appreciation for Rust, and familiarised me with this style of syntax. 

This website is actually generated using this generator! You can find repositories below for the generator itself and the markdown files it uses.

### Fixedsys Modern

Do you have a favourite font? I didn't until I found [Fixedsys Excelsior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixedsys); everything about that font clicked with me. 

I always had problems with reading (Dyslexia says hi). This font improved things, it might be due to vertical lines being thicker than the horizontal lines, as well as its overall simplicity and monospaced nature.  

Either way, I was happily using this font on my 24" 1920x1080 screen, however when time came to switch to 2560x1440 27" panel, I had an unfortunate realisation. Fixedsys is old, it does not scale well, and since there is higher pixel density on my new screen, it was uncomfortably tiny and almost unreadable. 

About a year and a half went by, and I tried a few different fonts; it was okay but never felt perfect like Fixedsys. Eventually, I realised I would probably not find something like that again, and that thought was rather depressing. 

Finally, I had enough; if no one is willing to make a modern version, I will make it myself! I started this project without any experience in Font design, or design, or even vector graphics for that matter. The next week was spent making iteration after iteration, testing, seeking feedback from other online users who missed Fixedsys as well, and making it slightly better each time. And finally, it was usable! \nIt is not perfect, but it is certainly better than hoping someone else makes it for me. 

This project taught me that having the audacity to try is very important. I had no business making fonts, yet I made my long-time dream come true! I have been using it ever since and love every second of it! The font itself, with all the materials I have made is on GitHub.

## Game Development

** Cauliflower Knight [Collaborative Final Uni Project UE4/C++] **
\nThis is the first project developed by [Walkover Games](https://walkover.games/), Cauliflower Knight is a 3D 
puzzle platformer where player controls two characters to solve puzzles, traverse 
levels and combat foes. Trailer of the demo can be found [here](https://youtu.be/378HCHSAj28). 


** Arcade Britannia VR [3D Models For UE4 VR Experience] **
\nThe goal of the project is to create an authentic VR experience of visiting the real arcade, overview of the  
internship results can be found [here](https://youtu.be/SKBBQA5U170). The project was [taken further](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/705814823354499092/976929686368174100/unknown-33.jpg) by MA 2021 students, I will be joining 
development team once again during my own MA in 2022.
