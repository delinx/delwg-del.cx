Sadly with the average resolution increasing, it became too small for comfortable use. And since it is a bitmap font, scaling results in blurry results. So eventually, I was forced to switch, but I have always missed it since. Finally, I had enough; if no one is willing to make a modern version of it, I will make it myself! I started this project without any experience in Font design, nor vector graphics. The next week was spent making iteration after iteration, seeking feedback from other online users who missed Fixedsys and making it slightly better each time. The final ready-to-use font with all materials I made is <a href="https://github.com/delinx/Fixedsys-Modern">available on GitHub</a>. This project taught me that having the audacity to try is very important. I had no business making fonts, yet I made my long-time wish come true! It is not perfect, but it is certainly better than hoping someone else makes it for me. </p><br><p><b> Cauliflower Knight [Collaborative Final Uni Project UE4/C++] </b><br>This is the first project developed by <a href="https://walkover.games/">Walkover Games</a>, Cauliflower Knight is a 3D puzzle platformer where player controls two characters to solve puzzles, traverse levels and combat foes. Trailer of the demo can be found <a href="https://youtu.be/378HCHSAj28">here</a>. </p><br><p><b> Arcade Britannia VR [3D Models For UE4 VR Experience] </b><br>The goal of the project is to create an authentic VR experience of visiting the real arcade, overview of the  internship results can be found <a href="https://youtu.be/SKBBQA5U170">here</a>. The project was <a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/705814823354499092/976929686368174100/unknown-33.jpg">taken further</a> by MA 2021 students, I will be joining development team once again during my own MA in 2022.</p><br><hr class="menuDivider">
