## Few projects
** Fixedsys Modern [Custom vector font based on old bitmap font] **
\nI am a big fan of Fixedsys Excelsior, which is an old DOS era bitmap font. Sadly with the average 
resolution increasing, it became too small for comfortable use. And since it is a bitmap font, 
scaling results in blurry results. So eventually, I was forced to switch, but I have always missed 
it since. Finally, I had enough; if no one is willing to make a modern version of it, I will make 
it myself! I started this project without any experience in Font design, nor vector graphics. 
The next week was spent making iteration after iteration, seeking feedback from other online users 
who missed Fixedsys and making it slightly better each time. The final ready-to-use font with all 
materials I made is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/delinx/Fixedsys-Modern). This project taught me that having the audacity to try is 
very important. I had no business making fonts, yet I made my long-time wish come true! It is not 
perfect, but it is certainly better than hoping someone else makes it for me. 


** Cauliflower Knight [Collaborative Final Uni Project UE4/C++] **
\nThis is the first project developed by [Walkover Games](https://walkover.games/), Cauliflower Knight is a 3D 
puzzle platformer where player controls two characters to solve puzzles, traverse 
levels and combat foes. Trailer of the demo can be found [here](https://youtu.be/378HCHSAj28). 


** Arcade Britannia VR [3D Models For UE4 VR Experience] **
\nThe goal of the project is to create an authentic VR experience of visiting the real arcade, overview of the  
internship results can be found [here](https://youtu.be/SKBBQA5U170). The project was [taken further](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/705814823354499092/976929686368174100/unknown-33.jpg) by MA 2021 students, I will be joining 
development team once again during my own MA in 2022.
